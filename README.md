# CS 3503 Assignment 2 - Direct Mapping Conversion
## Author
Kai Glaza
## Description
My implementation of Owl Techâ€™s direct mapping base conversion
## Build Instructions
```
bash

gcc main.c convert.c -o main

./main

```
## Test Results
51/51 Tests passed
## Notes
Learning the new operands like `~` and especially "`? A : B`" were the weirdest parts, but the "`? A : B`" was extremely useful in everything like a really weird `if-else-if`.
Hardest function to code was oct_to_hex having to figure out an easy way to make it into groups of 4.
Easiest parts were the compliments but mostly from my pre-exposure to it. 

Way less bumps now that I've used git before and now that I know more about C but not feeling anywhere near as confident with it as I do with something like Java
